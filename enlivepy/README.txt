==================================
enlivepy
==================================

enlivepy provides such and such and so and so. You might find
it most useful for tasks involving <x> and also <y>. Typical usage
often looks like this::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import enlivepy



A word on Sphinx
================
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
and ``monospace`` look like this.

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going

Urls are http://like.this and links can be
written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
